[Explanation of Database Locking](http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=83)

This is admittedly a bit more of an intermediate read. However, as a beginner, it would be good to try and read through it anyways. You won't understand everything, but you will at least be exposed to a decent explanation of why databases lock, which will come in handy throughout your time as a developer. You can always come back and read it again later if you want to try to get more out of it.
