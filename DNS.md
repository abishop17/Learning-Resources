------

I cannot sing high enough praises about this tutorial. It's relatively short, very engaging given the topic it's explaining, and very visual. You will leave with a great understanding of how DNS works. This may be the best DNS explanation on the internet.

For those unfamiliar, DNS is a process involved in HTTP - communication between the browser and your application's servers.
