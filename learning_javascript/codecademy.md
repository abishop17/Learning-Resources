[Codecademy JavaScript Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript)
------

This was the first coding tutorial I ever took. It introduced a lot of basic concepts (for loops, if statements) that made the Python tutorial go much more smoothly.

Also, given how strict and excessive JavaScript's syntax can be, this A) trains you to pay attention to small syntactical details that can break your program in the most frustrating way, and B) appreciate cleaner syntaxes, like Python (sorry, I'm biased).
