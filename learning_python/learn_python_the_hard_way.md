[Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
------

There is a paid version and a free online version (link in title). This review is about the free version.

This is a quick and dirty submersion into using Python on your operating system (i.e., on your actual computer through a command line). They teach you some basic bash commands for Python that certainly come in handy when you're working on a project.

They don’t teach you the best ways to do things, but it’s a much more holistic tutorial than codecademy. I would recommend doing the codecademy Python first so that you know the syntax and can focus more on the slightly deeper concepts of LPTHW.

The tutorial finishes by having you deploy a website.
