[Drag & Drop Tutorial](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/)

I initially struggled a lot with figuring out drag and drop uploading. However, of all the resources I found, this one had the clearest explanations and also was presented well visually.

Further, it includes examples of drag and drops to try out on the page, so within the tutorial you have the opportunity to interact with it and see the final result.
