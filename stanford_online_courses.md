[Stanford Online Courses](http://online.stanford.edu/courses/allcourses)
------

Stanford offers a huge variety of online courses that are free to the public. All you need to do is create an account. I took one in computer science, but there are a ton of others, and they change somewhat regularly so it's worth checking back again and again to find some you think would be interesting or helpful.

The courses involve video lectures with brief quizzes in between.
