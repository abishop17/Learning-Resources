[Design Patterns](http://www.uml.org.cn/c++/pdf/DesignPatterns.pdf)
------

Disclosure: The PDF link in the title isn't great but at the time of writing it was the best thing that came up when I googled "design patterns pdf."

Design Patterns, like SICP, is another classic. Unlike SICP, I would recommend reading this once you have a little bit of experience in writing code. The concepts will probably be a little easier to relate to once you have a tiny bit of experience. However, as with SICP, it's still good to claw your way through it, whether you understand it or not.

The examples in this book are mostly in C++, but if you google around you will probably be able to find examples of concepts in your comfort language.

It also serves as a nice reference book once you have read it.
