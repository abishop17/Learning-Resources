[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)](http://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf)
------

MIT uses this in their comp sci 101 course. It requires a bit of setup on your machine and a lot of the exercises are really tough. The answers to some of them were just published online, so you can use those to check your work, but if possible it is good to have a more experienced engineer around to field questions about this book and help with exercises.

While the exercises and material are pretty dense, at the end of the day it’s good to force your way through it. Chapters 1 and 2 are probably most helpful for a beginner, but it’s all really good stuff - the book was written in the 70s and has aged super well. I heard a rumor there is also an edition available in Python, but don't quote me on that.

A PDF of the book is online and linked to in the bio. Or you can purchase/borrow the real thing if that's more your style.
