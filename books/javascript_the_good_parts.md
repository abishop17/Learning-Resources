[JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://bdcampbell.net/javascript/book/javascript_the_good_parts.pdf)
------

This book is excellent, and also kind of funny in how much it shits on some parts of JavaScript and the way it was designed as a language.

It takes you through all the different components of JavaScript that were designed well and explains the quirks you have to deal with or avoid in order for it to work properly.

You can probably read it at any point after you've done a basic tutorial of JavaScript language and syntax.

Personally, I read this book when I started doing a lot more work in CoffeeScript after working in Python for a very long time. JavaScript was actually the first language I ever wrote in, but only for a short period of time before I went head first into Python. After a while there, I found that coming back to JavaScript files in our codebase was a nightmare and painful. This is because I was trying to write JavaScript as if it were Python. This book was a great reminder that that's not the case, and also exposed me to some great JavaScript functionality that I was totally missing.
