[Type Python, Press Enter. What Happens?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVhSjZYwZJo)

This is a great talk that dives into how Python actually works on your operating system. Very illuminating, and deals with content you wouldn't normaly find yourself as a beginner. Still, it's explained in a way a beginner can understand.

Another more personal reason I like this talk: I actually got a chance to talk to Phillip later on at the conference, and he told me that after they submitted this talk, they realized while preparing how little they knew and how much they had wrong (and readjusted accordingly). Pretty inspiring! Knowing that definitely made me less afraid to do a talk myself in the future.
